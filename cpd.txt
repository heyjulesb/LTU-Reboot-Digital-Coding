CPD activity

Positioning and Layout


What have I learnt?

In this session, we was taught about the different positioning and layout within HTML and CSS.
I also learnt more about margins, borders and padding which is something I always found hard to understand.


How did I use this in practice?

We added an image to our html page and positioned the caption to the image on the image.


What did I find hard?

I will need to play around with the absolute and relative positioning to understand how it can affect other elements.
